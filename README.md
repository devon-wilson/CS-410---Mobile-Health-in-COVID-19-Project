# CS 410: Mobile Health in COVID-19 - Final Project 

A simple health web application for weight watchers. Users can track their weight loss daily and see their progress with chart visuals.
Additionally, users are able to record their peak heartrate to determine a correlation between their weight and heartrate.
An analytics tab is provided for users to see their current BMI and how much of a risk COVID might play at their current health.
Additionally, users can log whether or not their are exhibiting COVID symptoms or have been exposed to COVID.

The front end portion was designed using React Native and the backend was developed using AWS(Lambda, DynamoDB, and API Gateway).

To run the application
```
npm start
```
